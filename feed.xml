It feels like anything could happen.</p><p>Investors shouldn't get too excited about these small green days. "Rallies have been nothing more than oversold counter trend snap backs. Volatility risk remains high. Put volume and sentiment may support a rally off the lows, but a reliable bottom has not yet to be established," said US trader Mark Minervini.</p><p>Nothing too exciting happened on the ETF front, as most were up or down between 2% and trying to stabilise after the market's recent selloff. </p><p>#1 Lithium</p><p>The VanEck Rare Earths/Strategic Metals ETF is trying to stabilise after an almost -30% correction from April highs. </p><p>The ETF tracks the performance of companies mining, refining and recycling rare earths and other strategic minerals. Its top 5 holdings include local names like Lynas, Pilbara Minerals and Allkem.</p><p>The sector was bolstered by a positive earnings release from US-listed lithium company, Livent. The company said it had no new capacity coming online this year, and all the upside was coming from pricing. </p><p>The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it will provide US$3.1bn in funding to support efforts to make EV batteries and components in the US. Separately, the Department of Energy said an additional US$60m will be available to support the reuse and recycling of used EV batteries.</p><p>The ETF is in a rather fragile position, previously slicing through key support areas like the 200-day and $96 level (red band) with ease. Until the ETF can reclaim such support areas, small green days shouldn't be taken too seriously. </p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/5elfKCP41mo14L3QkGx3av/6556d9a3c2e8a985cc27781c2dc09201/2022-05-04_08_06_50-REMX_2022-05-04_08-06-46.png_-_Photos.png" alt="2022-05-04 08 06 50-REMX 2022-05-04 08-06-46.png ‎- Photos"/><p>Source: TradingView, Annotations by Market Index</p><p>Nevertheless, the small overnight bounce could see some positive flow for local names. </p><p>#2 Energy</p><p>OPEC+ is due to meet on Thursday to discuss oil output.
